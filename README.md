one of my first big coding projects.

At the same time as i fell in love with webdevelopment, i was enrolled in a special computer science school for adults with autism.

even though the school was focused on IT they didnt use any it solutions when it came to handing out assignment, material for self study, visualising student progress, helping with an overview og the semesters ect.

so i decided to try and make a web based app for both students, teaches and special consultants that encapsulates all that it meant to be studying or working in the school.

sadley i did not finish before my time on the school was over.
